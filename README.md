# DSCI_525_Group_19 - Rainfall Analysis

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Ensemble Machine Learning Models for Rainfall Prediction project! In this GitHub repository, you will find all the code and resources needed to build and deploy an ensemble machine learning model to predict daily rainfall in Australia using a large dataset of climate model outputs. The dataset hosted on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681), which is approximately 6 GB in size, contains various features that have been derived from different climate models, while the target variable is the actual rainfall observation. Our goal is to develop a high-performing model that can accurately predict daily rainfall in different regions of Australia, leveraging the power of cloud computing. This project will involve data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. We hope that this project will be both fun and educational, and we welcome contributors of all skill levels to join us in this exciting endeavor!
